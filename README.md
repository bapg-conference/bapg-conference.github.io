1. If you don't have one already, you will need a GitHub account ([Sign Up](https://github.com/signup)).
2. Back on the homepage of this repository, click "Fork" in the top right corner of your web browser. Click "Create fork". This will create a copy of the repository within your account.

3. Save the information from the last conference by doing the following:
    - Click "index.md" and copy the contents by clicking the symbol with two squares next to the trashcan.
    - Click "bapg-conference.github.io" to return to the main repository, then enter the "previous" folder. There you should see Markdown files from previous conferences.
    - Click "Add file", "Create new file", name the file following the same naming convention (seasonYEAR) and paste the copied contents.
4. Now, its time to edit the files with your conference information:
    - Click "index.md" and then the pencil at the top right of the document. This will allow you to edit the document.

    - Update the title to "BAPG [*Season*] [*Year*]" and add your content using Markdown syntax. Try to follow the same general formatting as previous conferences.
    - If you want to add pictures, you can conveniently drag and drop them into the editor. Individuals logos can be grouped together into a single image prior to adding to the editor using Powerpoint or Photoshop to achieve a desired logo layout.
    - Within the editor, you can also preview your content, though the styling will not necessarily match what how it will render on the website.
    - Once complete, click "Commit changes".
5. To send your updates to the original repository, click "Pull requests", "New pull request", and "Create pull request". Add a short description that describes the changes that you made. The repository administrators will check through your changes then approve and add them to the website.
